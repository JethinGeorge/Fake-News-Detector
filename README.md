# Fake News Detector using Machine Learning

This project aims to build a **Fake News Detection System** using machine learning techniques. It classifies news articles as **fake or real** based on the text content. The model was trained on a labeled dataset and uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract features from the news content.

# Project Overview

-  **Dataset**: Labeled news articles (real and fake)
-  **Algorithm**: Logistic Regression / Naive Bayes / Random Forest (customizable)
-  **Goal**: Classify news content as Real or Fake

##  Technologies Used

- Python 
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- NLTK / spaCy (for text preprocessing)
- Google Colab


##  Features

- Text preprocessing (stop word removal, stemming/lemmatization)
- TF-IDF vectorization
- Machine learning model training
- Accuracy and confusion matrix evaluation
- Real-time prediction for custom input


##  How to Run

1. Open the notebook: `fakenews.ipynb` in Google Colab or Jupyter
2. Run all cells in order:
   - Load the dataset
   - Preprocess the text
   - Vectorize using TF-IDF
   - Train the model
   - Test and evaluate accuracy
   - Try custom predictions
